## üöÄ CLI Usage Examples

The LANS CLI is now fully operational:

```bash
# Interactive mode
python lans_cli.py

# Show system status  
python lans_cli.py status

# Assign LLM to agent role
python lans_cli.py assign coder phi4-mini:latest

# Execute natural language commands
python lans_cli.py "create a Python web server"
python lans_cli.py "setup a new FastAPI project"
python lans_cli.py "analyze this codebase for issues"

# Use custom configuration
python lans_cli.py --config ./my-config.json

# Get help
python lans_cli.py --help
```
