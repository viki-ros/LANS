  - [ ] Test real file watching and diff generation
  - [ ] Implement file tree display with live updates
  - [ ] Test file operations (read, write, create, delete)

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY - User Interface
- [ ] **Command & Cognition Center**
  - [ ] Real command input and execution
  - [ ] Context attachment (files, URLs, text)
  - [ ] Thought stream visualization
  - [ ] Agent mode switching
  
- [ ] **Live Workspace**
  - [ ] Monaco Editor integration with real file content
  - [ ] Real-time file change visualization
  - [ ] Terminal panel integration
  - [ ] File tree with actual project structure

- [ ] **System Monitor**
  - [ ] Real memory usage visualization
  - [ ] Process monitoring with actual data
  - [ ] Performance metrics dashboard

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Polish & Features
- [ ] **Error Handling & Recovery**
  - [ ] WebSocket reconnection logic
  - [ ] Graceful error display
  - [ ] Fallback modes when services are down
  
- [ ] **Testing Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Unit tests for components
  - [ ] Integration tests for WebSocket communication
  - [ ] E2E tests for full workflow

### üîµ LOW PRIORITY - Advanced Features
- [ ] **AIL Power User Mode**
- [ ] **Advanced Memory Explorer**
- [ ] **Multi-project support**
- [ ] **Theme and customization**

## Testing Checklist

### Backend API Tests
- [‚úÖ] Health endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishment
- [ ] File watcher detects changes
- [ ] Terminal session creation
- [ ] Command execution through agent
- [ ] Memory introspection data

### Frontend Integration Tests  
- [ ] WebSocket connects to agent host
- [ ] Components receive and display real data
- [ ] User interactions trigger backend actions
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully

### End-to-End Workflow Tests
- [ ] Complete development session simulation
- [ ] File editing triggers real updates
- [ ] Commands execute and show output
- [ ] Agent thoughts are displayed in real-time

## Development Session Log

### Session 1 - Foundation Setup ‚úÖ
- Renamed agentros ‚Üí LANS, kernel functions to agentos
- Created LANS ICE design documents
- Set up agent host with FastAPI + WebSocket
- Set up desktop app with React + Vite
- Established basic communication protocol

### Session 2 - Real Implementation (CURRENT)
**Goal**: Test actual functionality, not just scaffolding

**Next Steps:**
1. Test WebSocket communication with real messages
2. Implement terminal integration with actual command execution
3. Add file system integration with live updates
4. Create working Command & Cognition Center

## Bug Tracking

### Known Issues
- [ ] CommandHandler initialization error in agent manager
- [ ] PostCSS config needed ES module syntax (FIXED)
- [ ] xterm packages deprecated (low priority)

### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Agent Host health check: PASS
- ‚úÖ Frontend dev server: PASS  
- ‚úÖ Context attachment API: PASS (context_id generated)
- ‚úÖ File listing API: PASS (returns project structure)
- ‚úÖ WebSocket connection: PASS (tester component added)
- [ ] Real-time file notifications: IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Terminal integration: IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Command execution: PENDING

## Performance Targets
- WebSocket latency: <100ms
- File change detection: <500ms
- UI responsiveness: 60fps
- Memory usage: <1GB total

## Security Checklist
- [ ] WebSocket authentication
- [ ] File system access controls
- [ ] Command execution sandboxing
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
