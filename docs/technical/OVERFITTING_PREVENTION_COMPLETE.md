## 🚀 **PRODUCTION INTEGRATION**

### **Memory Manager Integration**
The overfitting prevention is seamlessly integrated into the GlobalMemoryManager:

```python
# Memory storage pipeline with prevention
async def store_memory_with_prevention(self, memory_data):
    # 1. Overfitting prevention checks
    should_store, results = await self.overfitting_prevention.process_memory_storage(memory_data)
    
    if not should_store:
        return {"status": "rejected", "reason": results["final_decision"]}
    
    # 2. Store memory with adjusted importance
    memory_id = await self._store_memory_internal(memory_data)
    
    # 3. Track for future prevention
    await self.overfitting_prevention.track_storage_success(memory_id)
    
    return {"status": "stored", "memory_id": memory_id}
```

### **Database Schema Integration**
```sql
-- Enhanced memory table with overfitting tracking
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN overfitting_risk_score FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN domain_validation_score FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0;
ALTER TABLE memories ADD COLUMN pattern_diversity_score FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0;

-- Indexes for overfitting analysis
CREATE INDEX idx_memories_overfitting_risk ON memories(overfitting_risk_score DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_memories_domain_validation ON memories(domain_validation_score DESC);
```
