# Project Phoenix: A Unified Development Proposal for the AIL-3.0 AgentOS Kernel

**Document ID:** AILOS-DP-v1.0  
**Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Status:** Official Development Mandate  
**Classification:** Strategic Development Specification  

---

## 1. Executive Mandate

This document outlines the strategic evolution of the existing **Global Memory MCP Server (GMCP)** into the **AIL-3.0 AgentOS Kernel**. This is not a rewrite, but a targeted, high-impact upgrade. We will leverage the robust, production-ready backend, storage, and operational infrastructure of the GMCP as the foundation upon which we will build a new, intelligent cognitive layer.

The core of this evolution is the replacement of the GMCP's granular, multi-endpoint REST API with a **single, powerful, intent-driven `/cognition` endpoint** that accepts the **Agent Instruction Language (AIL-3.0)**. The agent's role will be simplified to that of an "intent generator," while the Kernel will be elevated to an intelligent "intent executor."

This proposal contains the complete technical specification for AIL-3.0 and the phased development plan for its implementation.

## 2. The Agent Instruction Language (AIL) - Version 3.0 "Kernel" Edition: Complete Specification

### 2.1 Language Philosophy

AIL is a purpose-built language for an AI agent to communicate its **cognitive intent**, not a list of imperative commands. It is a machine-readable "language of thought" designed for efficiency, precision, and verifiability. Its structure is a LISP-like S-expression, representing a thought as a tree of operations and entities. AIL code is generated by an "Encoder" module within an agent and executed by the AgentOS Kernel.

### 2.2 Formal Grammar (EBNF)

```ebnf
cognition        ::= '(' OPERATION (argument | cognition)* ')'
argument         ::= entity | literal | metadata

operation        ::= 'QUERY' | 'EXECUTE' | 'PLAN' | 'COMMUNICATE'
entity           ::= '[' IDENTIFIER ':' VECTOR ']'
literal          ::= string | number | boolean | null
vector           ::= (* A high-dimensional array of floats, represented in binary *)
identifier       ::= string

metadata         ::= '{' (key_value_pair (',' key_value_pair)*)? '}'
key_value_pair   ::= string ':' literal

string           ::= '"' (character)* '"'
number           ::= (* standard integer or float *)
boolean          ::= 'true' | 'false'
null             ::= 'null'
```

### 2.3 Core Operations

AIL-3.0 simplifies the language by making the **QUERY operation exceptionally intelligent**.

#### 2.3.1 QUERY Operation
- **`(QUERY { ... })`**: The heart of AIL-3.0. A unified instruction for all memory retrieval, exploration, and synthesis tasks. The agent specifies its high-level intent, and the Kernel is responsible for devising and executing the optimal search plan.

#### 2.3.2 Supporting Operations
- **`(EXECUTE [tool_entity] [parameter_entity])`**: A direct command to the Kernel to execute a registered external tool (e.g., an API call, a shell command, a code interpreter).

- **`(PLAN {goal=...} (cognition_1) ...)`**: A sequence of cognitions used when the agent needs to define an explicit, multi-step workflow. This is now used for imperative tasks, not for complex memory retrieval, which is handled by QUERY.

- **`(COMMUNICATE [recipient_entity] (cognition_to_send))`**: Sends a complete AIL cognition to another agent, enabling multi-agent collaboration.

### 2.4 QUERY Operation Specification

The **QUERY operation** accepts a single metadata block as its argument, describing the desired outcome.

#### Required Field:
- **`"intent"`**: (string) A clear, natural language description of the ultimate goal. This is the primary input for the Kernel's intelligent query planner.

#### Optional Fields:
- **`"mode"`**: (string) `"standard"` | `"explore"` | `"connect"`. Defaults to `"standard"`.
  - **`"standard"`**: For direct fact retrieval.
  - **`"explore"`**: To understand the shape of data. The Kernel will return categorical facets and summaries alongside the top results.
  - **`"connect"`**: To find relationships between concepts. Requires `start_node_query` and `end_node_query`.

- **`"return"`**: (array of strings) Specifies the desired format and content of the result (e.g., `["summary", "top_5_results", "shortest_connection_path"]`).

- **`"performance_profile"`**: (string) `"high_precision"` | `"high_recall"` | `"fastest"`. A hint to the Kernel's query planner to optimize its strategy.

- **`"start_node_query"`**: (string) Used in connect mode to define the first concept.

- **`"end_node_query"`**: (string) Used in connect mode to define the second concept.

### 2.5 AIL-3.0 Usage Examples

#### Simple Retrieval:
**Intent**: "Find me my notes about the AIL-3.0 specification."  
**AIL Code**: `(QUERY {"intent": "Find my notes about the AIL-3.0 specification"})`

#### Exploratory Query:
**Intent**: "What were the main topics of my conversations with Evelyn last week?"  
**AIL Code**: `(QUERY {"intent": "What were the main topics of my conversations with Evelyn last week?", "mode": "explore", "return": ["summary_facets"]})`

#### Connection Query:
**Intent**: "I suspect our Q3 marketing push caused the recent spike in API usage. Is there a connection?"  
**AIL Code**: `(QUERY {"intent": "Find a connection between the Q3 marketing push and the recent API usage spike", "mode": "connect"})`

#### Tool Execution:
**Intent**: "Check the current system status."  
**AIL Code**: `(EXECUTE [tool_shell] ["ps aux | grep python"])`

#### Multi-step Plan:
**Intent**: "Research competitors and create a summary report."  
**AIL Code**: 
```lisp
(PLAN 
  {"goal": "Research competitors and create summary report"}
  (QUERY {"intent": "Find all stored information about our main competitors"})
  (EXECUTE [tool_web_search] ["latest competitor analysis 2025"])
  (QUERY {"intent": "Synthesize competitor data into strategic insights", "return": ["executive_summary"]})
)
```

## 3. The Phased Integration & Development Plan

This plan will guide the evolution of the existing GMCP into the AIL-3.0 AgentOS Kernel.

### Phase 1: API Foundation & AIL Parser (Foundation)

**Goal**: Replace the granular REST API with the single `/cognition` endpoint. This is the most critical architectural change.

#### 3.1.1 Modify the FastAPI Server:
- Review `part-v-api-integration.md` from the GMCP documentation.
- Deprecate all existing endpoints (`/memories/{type}`, `/memories/search`, etc.). They can be left in a "maintenance mode" but will not be further developed.
- Implement a single new primary endpoint: **`POST /cognition`**. This endpoint will accept a JSON object: `{"ail_code": "(...)"`.

#### 3.1.2 Implement the AIL Parser:
- Create a robust, secure parser for the AIL S-expression syntax as defined in Section 2.2. This parser will convert the AIL string into a Python object tree.

#### 3.1.3 Create the Kernel's Executor Stub:
- In the existing `GlobalMemoryManager` class, rename it to `AgentOSKernel`.
- Create the primary method: `execute_cognition(self, parsed_ail)`.
- This method will act as a simple dispatcher. It will look at the root OPERATION of the parsed AIL and call a corresponding (currently placeholder) internal method, e.g., `_handle_query(args)`, `_handle_execute(args)`.

**Success Metric**: The server starts, the old endpoints are gone, and the `/cognition` endpoint can successfully receive AIL code, parse it without errors, and log that it is dispatching to the correct (placeholder) handler function.

### Phase 2: Intelligent Query Engine (Core Intelligence)

**Goal**: Breathe life into the Kernel by implementing the core logic for the AIL-3.0 QUERY operation.

#### 3.2.1 Develop the `_handle_query` Method: 
This is the masterwork. This function, inside the Kernel, will receive the arguments from a `(QUERY ...)` cognition.

#### 3.2.2 Intent Parsing (Initial Version): 
For this phase, use a simple keyword-based approach to parse the intent string. Extract key entities, date ranges, and concepts. (A more advanced LLM-based intent parser can be a future improvement).

#### 3.2.3 Implement the Query Planner: 
Based on the parsed intent and the mode parameter, this planner will construct a multi-stage database query plan.

**Example**: If the intent contains a date range and a semantic concept, the planner will decide to filter by the date first (a fast SQL WHERE clause) and then run the vector search on the smaller result set.

#### 3.2.4 Database Interaction: 
The planner will execute its plan against the perfectly designed PostgreSQL database schemas from `part-iv-storage-infrastructure.md`.

#### 3.2.5 Return Synthesized Results: 
Package the final results as requested by the `return` field in the QUERY arguments.

**Success Metric**: An agent can now send a single, intent-driven QUERY cognition (like the examples in 2.5) and receive an intelligent, synthesized answer. The complexity of the multi-stage search is completely hidden from the agent.

### Phase 3: Full AIL Operations & External Integration (Ecosystem)

**Goal**: Implement the remaining AIL operations and connect the Kernel to the outside world.

#### 3.3.1 Implement EXECUTE:
- Create a `ToolRegistry` class within the Kernel.
- Implement the `_handle_execute` method. This method will look up the requested tool in the registry and run it, passing the specified parameters.
- For testing, register a simple "shell command" tool.

#### 3.3.2 Implement PLAN & COMMUNICATE:
- The `_handle_plan` method will simply iterate through the sub-cognitions in the plan and call `execute_cognition` on each one sequentially.
- The `_handle_communicate` method will be a stub for now that logs the message and recipient, but it lays the groundwork for future multi-agent systems.

**Success Metric**: An agent can now ask the Kernel to perform actions on its behalf (e.g., `(EXECUTE [tool_shell] ["ls -l"])`) and can define simple, explicit plans. The AgentOS is now a fully functional, albeit v1, operating system.
